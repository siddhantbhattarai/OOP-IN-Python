    "### Section 4: Inheritance and Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inheritance\n",
    "- Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming where a new class (subclass or derived class) is created by inheriting properties and methods from an existing class (superclass or base class).\n",
    "- It allows the subclass to reuse the code of the superclass, thereby promoting code reusability and facilitating the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extending Classes\n",
    "- To create a subclass, use the syntax `class SubClassName(BaseClassName):`.\n",
    "- The subclass inherits attributes and methods from the base class.\n",
    "- Additional attributes and methods can be added to the subclass, extending the functionality of the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overriding Methods\n",
    "- Subclasses can override methods inherited from the base class by providing a new implementation.\n",
    "- This allows for customization of behavior specific to the subclass while retaining the same method signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "- Python supports multiple inheritance, where a subclass can inherit from multiple base classes.\n",
    "- This allows for the combination of features and behaviors from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Polymorphism\n",
    "- Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on different forms or behaviors depending on their context.\n",
    "- In Python, polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding and operator overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method Overriding\n",
    "- Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
    "- When an overridden method is called for an object of the subclass, the subclass's version of the method is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Operator Overloading\n",
    "- Operator overloading allows custom classes to define their behavior for built-in operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.\n",
    "- This is achieved by implementing special methods, such as `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, `__div__`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Duck Typing\n",
    "- Duck typing is a concept in dynamic programming languages like Python where the type or class of an object is determined by its behavior rather than its inheritance hierarchy.\n",
    "- If an object behaves like a duck (i.e., it quacks like a duck and swims like a duck), then it's treated as a duck.\n",
    "\n",

    "The \"diamond problem\" is a common issue in multiple inheritance, particularly in programming languages like C++ that support it. It occurs when a subclass inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor. If both parent classes implement a method with the same name, and the subclass does not override it, ambiguity arises in determining which version of the method to use.\n",

This means that when a method is called on an object, Python first looks for the method in the class of the object, then in its parent classes in the order they were listed in the subclass declaration.\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve the diamond problem in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use careful class design to avoid multiple inheritance if possible. Favor composition over inheritance where appropriate.\n",
    "2. If multiple inheritance is necessary, be mindful of method naming and overriding to minimize ambiguity.\n",
    "3. Understand Python's method resolution order (MRO) and how it affects method lookup in subclasses. You can view the MRO of a class using the `__mro__` attribute or the `mro()` method.\n",
    "4. Explicitly override methods in the subclass if necessary to provide a clear resolution for method calls.\n",

    "Multiple inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming languages that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes. While it offers certain advantages, it also comes with its own set of challenges and potential pitfalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "1. **Code Reusability**: Multiple inheritance allows a subclass to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes, facilitating code reuse. This can lead to more modular and maintainable code, as common functionality can be shared across different parts of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enhanced Flexibility**: With multiple inheritance, a subclass can combine features from different parent classes, enabling greater flexibility in class design. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where a class needs to exhibit behavior from multiple domains or categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Promotes Modularity**: By breaking down functionality into smaller, more specialized classes, multiple inheritance promotes modularity and separation of concerns. This can improve the organization and structure of a codebase, making it easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "1. **Ambiguity and Complexity**: Multiple inheritance can lead to ambiguity and complexity, especially when conflicts arise between inherited attributes or methods with the same name or signature. This can make it challenging to predict the behavior of a subclass, resulting in potential errors and debugging difficulties.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Diamond Problem**: The diamond problem is a specific issue that arises in multiple inheritance when a subclass inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor. This can lead to ambiguity in method resolution, as illustrated in the \"diamond problem\" example discussed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Overcomplication and Tight Coupling**: While multiple inheritance offers flexibility, it can also lead to overcomplicated class hierarchies and tight coupling between classes. Excessive use of multiple inheritance can make a codebase difficult to understand and maintain, especially for developers unfamiliar with the design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where you have classes representing different types of vehicles, such as `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat`, each with its own set of attributes and methods. You might want to create a subclass `AmphibiousVehicle` that can exhibit behaviors of both a `Car` and a `Boat`, inheriting from both parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- Code reusability: `AmphibiousVehicle` can inherit common attributes and methods from both `Car` and `Boat`.\n",
    "- Flexibility: `AmphibiousVehicle` can seamlessly transition between land and water, combining features of both parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Ambiguity: If both `Car` and `Boat` have a method named `move()`, it's unclear which implementation `AmphibiousVehicle` should use.\n",
    "- Complexity: Managing interactions and potential conflicts between inherited attributes and methods from multiple parent classes can introduce complexity and reduce maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while multiple inheritance can be a powerful tool for code organization and reuse, it requires careful consideration and design to avoid pitfalls such as ambiguity and overcomplication. In many cases, alternative approaches such as composition or interface inheritance may be preferable for achieving similar goals with fewer drawbacks."

    "\n",
    "2. **Left-to-Right Precedence**: In the case of multiple inheritance, the order in which base classes are listed in the class definition affects the MRO. Python follows a left-to-right precedence rule, meaning that methods and attributes from the leftmost base class are preferred over those from the rightmost base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **C3 Linearization Algorithm**: Python's MRO is computed using the C3 linearization algorithm, which ensures that the method resolution order satisfies three consistency criteria:\n",
    "    - Children precede their parents.\n",
    "    - If a class inherits from multiple classes, their order in the inheritance list is preserved.\n",
    "    - If a class inherits from multiple classes and those classes have a common ancestor, the order of appearance in the inheritance list is respected.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Relevance in Multiple Inheritance**: MRO is particularly relevant in multiple inheritance scenarios, where a subclass inherits from more than one base class. It helps determine the order in which base classes are searched for methods and attributes, resolving potential conflicts and ensuring a consistent and predictable behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Diamond Problem Resolution**: MRO plays a crucial role in resolving the diamond problem, which occurs when a subclass inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor. By following a specific MRO, Python ensures that methods and attributes are looked up in a consistent and unambiguous manner, mitigating the diamond problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding MRO and its implications is essential for writing maintainable and predictable code, especially in the context of multiple inheritance. It allows developers to design class hierarchies effectively, manage method conflicts, and ensure correct method resolution behavior across different parts of a program."

    "Method overloading is a programming concept where a class can have multiple methods with the same name but with different parameters or different numbers of parameters. The method that gets called is determined by the number of arguments or their types. This allows developers to create multiple methods with the same name but different behaviors based on the input parameters.\n",

    "Here's how method overloading can be achieved in Python:\n",

    "1. **Default Argument Values**: You can define a method with default argument values and then use conditional logic inside the method to handle different cases based on the provided arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variable-Length Argument Lists**: Python allows you to define methods that accept a variable number of arguments using `*args` or `**kwargs` syntax. This allows you to create a single method that can handle different numbers or types of arguments.\n",

    "print(\"Result 2:\", math_ops.add(2, 3))   # Output: 5 (Two arguments)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The `add()` method of the `MathOperations` class is defined with a default argument value (`y=None`). \n",
    "- If the `add()` method is called with only one argument, it returns the value of that argument.\n",
    "- If the `add()` method is called with two arguments, it returns the sum of the two arguments.\n",
    "- This demonstrates method overloading behavior, where the same method name (`add()`) is used to perform different operations based on the number of arguments provided.\n",

    "In Python, interfaces are not explicitly defined like in statically-typed languages such as Java or C#. However, the concept of interfaces can still be achieved through abstract base classes (ABCs) and duck typing, both of which play a role in achieving polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)**:\n",
    "   Abstract base classes in Python serve as blueprints for other classes and define a common interface that subclasses must implement. They provide a way to define methods that must be implemented by concrete subclasses, thus ensuring a consistent interface across different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here's how ABCs contribute to polymorphism:\n",

    "   - Polymorphism is achieved when different objects, regardless of their specific class, can be treated uniformly based on their shared interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Duck Typing**:\n",
    "   Duck typing is a principle in Python that focuses on an object's behavior rather than its type. It implies that if an object behaves like a duck (i.e., it has the required methods and attributes), then it can be treated as a duck, regardless of its actual type.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here's how duck typing contributes to polymorphism:\n",
    "   - Python allows objects of different classes to be used interchangeably if they support the same set of methods and attributes, regardless of their inheritance hierarchy.\n",
    "   - This flexibility enables polymorphic behavior, where different objects can respond to the same method call in different ways based on their internal implementation.\n",
    "   - Polymorphism through duck typing allows for more dynamic and flexible code, as objects can be used in contexts where their specific class is not known in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while Python does not have interfaces in the traditional sense, abstract base classes and duck typing serve similar roles in achieving polymorphism. By defining common interfaces through ABCs and relying on an object's behavior rather than its type through duck typing, Python promotes code reuse, flexibility, and polymorphic behavior across different objects and classes."
